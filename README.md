# Welcome to Shelve It!

Shelve It is a new internet community that allows users to read user-generated stories and authors to create those stories. Stories can be sorted through genre, including drama, fiction, horror, non-fiction, and anything else under the sun. With your mind as the script, your hands as pens, and our app as your paper, anything is possible!

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites

What you will need to install:

### Installing dependancies:

It is as easy as going into your terminal/powershell in VS Code and typing:

npm i

This will command your computer to download a `node_modules` folder with all the dependancies inside of it.
