# Welcome to Shelve It!

Shelve-It is our group project at Southern Methodist University bootcamp. The team members are Justin Cheng, Emir Velasqez, Jhalya Young, and Hibah Shafi. This our first full stack project and the languages and technologies we will be using will be HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node Express, MySQL, SQL, ORM, CRUD, MVC, quill editor, After Effects, Firebase DB, etc. The idea for this project came from our passion to read books and support unpublished authors. Our target audience are readers and authors.

Shelve-It mission is to create a new internet community to support low-ley authors.

Shelve-It is a storytelling platform for amateur authors and eager readers. For readers, it consists of a digital library and the ability to search a book using Google API. For authors, it is a free online writing site that provides the tools for writers to publish their work. Shelve-It publishes fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. Open to published and unpublished writers, we aim to showcase exceptional work only.

With your mind as the script, your hands as pens, and our app as your paper, anything is possible!
